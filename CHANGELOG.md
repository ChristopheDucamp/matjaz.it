Change Log
==========

All notable changes to the structure and content of the blog
[matjaz.it](http://matjaz.it/) will be documented in this file.

This changelog tries to adehe to the
[Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com) format as much as possible. The
notable exceptions are:

- no [Semantic versioning](http://semver.org): the version numbers are simply
  dates in ISO format since each version of the blog means a new post/page or a
  change of the content, not a new feature, bugfix or compatibility break, since
  the website is completely static.
- no `Deprecated` and `Security` group changes: same reason as previous point.


[Unreleased]
------------

### Added

- Blog structure made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). The content is imported
  from my previous version of the blog, **URLs should mostly be the same**.
- Custom theme based on the [Hugo Zen](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-zen/) theme
  with contact icons from [Decode](https://www.machothemes.com/themes/decode/)
  theme for Wordpress.
- This Changelog, the Readme and the License of the project.


### Changed

- The home page now lists just the titles of the posts instead of the full
  content for the sake of simplicity and less bandwidth.
- The RSS feed has a new link: <http://matjaz.it/index.xml> instead of
  <http://matjaz.it/feed/>.
- The website content I wrote is now under the
  [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
- The [robots.txt](http://matjaz.it/robots.txt) file is much simplier.
- Simplified the 404 error page.
- Customized footer content and date format.

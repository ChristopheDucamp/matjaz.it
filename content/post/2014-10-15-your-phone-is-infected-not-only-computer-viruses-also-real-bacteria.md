Sometimes our devices get infected, but not always is about computer
viruses. Sometimes is the real ones...

We all know that you should wash you hands after touching money, because money
travels from hand to hand and everybody touched them. But how many times have
you cleaned your phone?

I'm not talking about rubbing the screen on your T-shirt, I'm talking about
**disinfection**. Some
[studies](http://center4research.org/i-saw-it-on-the-internet/are-there-more-bacteria-on-computer-keyboards-than-toilet-seats/)
show that there is much more bacteria on your smartphone or computer keyboard
than on your toilet seat. Clean them!


## "Alcohol is the solution!"

A routine I have is to disinfect my stuff periodically. I do it **every few
months** (sometimes 1, sometimes 3). I use **ethyl alcohol** to deeply clean and
disinfect at the same time. The con is that the stuff you clean stays smelly for
about an hour and you have to open the windows, but it's not tragic.


## What should I clean?

My rule of thumb is: _stuff you usually touch during the day but usually don't
clean._

A warning: **don't clean too often** because it weakens your immune system. What
"too often" means, that's another can of worms (see upper disclaimer).

Extra tip: **wash your hands regularly**.


## My personal list

My list of stuff-that-needs-periodical-disinfection:

1. Phone[*]: alcohol
   [may damage the touch screen](http://lifehacker.com/5665119/how-to-safely-disinfect-and-clean-your-gadgets),
   but should not be a problem if you use a screen protector;
2. Laptop computer*****: touchpad, keyboard. Use a clean cloth for the screen if
   not sure;
3. USB Sticks: especially those passed to other people;
4. Chargers;
5. Keys;
6. Wallet: deeply, because of the money;
7. Glasses[*]: use some specific cleaning product if not sure;
8. Desktop computer[*]: mouse and **keyboard** (unmount all keys, if possible,
   and clean them on every side + the inside of your keyboard), power button,
   screen buttons;
9. TV or other remotes;
10. Game console controllers;
11. Desk;
12. Pens, pencils and other stationary you use often;
13. Pencil case;
14. Bag/backpack: washing them is often enough;
15. Door handles;
16. Light switches;
17. Car: steering wheel, gear lever, all handles.

[*]: alcohol may damage the product or parts of it, like the screen, color,
lenses coating. If you are not 100% sure of what you do, check the
manufacturer's guidelines about cleaning it.

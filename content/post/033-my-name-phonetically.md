My name is hard to pronounce and type for most, so here's a guide.

The diacritical sign `ˇ` on top of the `z` and `s`
is technically called an 
[_Inverted circumflex_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caron), 
most often known as _caron_, _haček_ or _strešica_.


## Pronunciation

The first in the lists is the pronunciation written in the
[International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English)
which may be the most generic way to write it. For those who are not familiar
with it, there are some pronunciations as they could be written in some common
languages.


### First name: Matjaž

- IPA: `matj’aʒ`
- English: `mah-tee-àh-s` - **s** like in _televi**s**ion_
- Italiano: `ma-tiàj` - **j** come in francese _bon **j**our_
- Deutsch: `ma-tjàj` - erse **j** wie in _**j**a_, zweite **j** wie in _Gara**g**e_


### Family name: Guštin

- IPA: `guʃ'tin`
- English: `goosh-tèen`
- Italiano: `gusc-tìn` - **sc** come in _**sc**ivolo_
- Deutsch: `gusch-tìn`


## Writing and typing

In longhand, just write a small `v` above the `z` and the `s` characters. 
When typing on a computer, there are a few tricks to do it.


### Simply copy-paste from here

- `Matjaž Guštin`
- `MATJAŽ GUŠTIN`


### Use the codes

Your operating system may accept numeric codes instead of a character and write
the character instead.


#### On Windows

Press and hold the Alt key, type the numbers as follows on the numeric keypad 
(ensure that Num Lock is activated). Then release the Alt key.

- `ž` = Alt + 0158
- `Ž` = Alt + 0142
- `š` = Alt + 0154 (also Alt + 0353 works)
- `Š` = Alt + 0138 (also Alt + 0352 works)


#### On Linux (with an X Window System)

Hold Ctrl+Shift, type `U` followed by the required digits as follows. Then 
release Ctrl+Shift.

- `ž` = 017E
- `Ž` = 017D
- `š` = 0161
- `Š` = 0160


#### On macOS

Open the _Emoji & Symbols_ menu with Command+Ctrl+Space. Type `caron` in the 
search box, the characters should be in the search results.

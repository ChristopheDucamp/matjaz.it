Not much to tell. I thought a nice SQL-programming exercise would be to see how
a deck of cards could be implemented in a database. It's simple and
straightforward but got me thinking a bit.

[Check it out on GitHub](https://github.com/TheMatjaz/sql-playcard). I
programmed different versions of the same solution for PostgreSQL, MySQL and
SQLite (this one in 2 versions). Everything is BSD licensed, use it as you wish.

At first I thought about a _user defined data type_ (yay PostgreSQL!), but then
I realized that the instances of the problem were limited, thus a simple
relation would suffice.Â A lesson for the future:

A standard french playing deck (yes, that's the official name for the _Poker
cards_) contains 52 cards, 13 for each suit, and two jokers. In my solution I
added an additional _Covered card_ for a card with unknown value.

I started to use GnuPG and it looks pretty cool, although its user experience is
just awful. The complexity is high enough to make you do mistakes without even
realizing it. On the other hand, modern encryption protocols and systems like
[Signal](https://whispersystems.org/) are **much** more user-friendly.

But PGP systems get really useful for signatures, for instance for signing _Git_
commits.

Happy e-mailing!

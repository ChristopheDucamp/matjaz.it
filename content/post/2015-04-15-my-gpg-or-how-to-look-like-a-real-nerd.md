I started to use GnuPG and it looks pretty cool, although it's "so 90s" :) It gets really useful for signatures, for instance for signing _git_ commits. On the other hand, modern encryption protocols and systems like [Signal](http://whispersystems.org/) are **much** more user-friendly.

Happy e-mailing!

Among many [TED](https://www.ted.com) talks I stumbled upon
[David Pogue's 10 top time-saving tech tips](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_pogue_10_top_time_saving_tech_tips). I
liked it because it's simple, fast and effective: it's a list of many tips that
will help you a lot, like how to save time when scrolling a web page or how to
use Google as a calculator. Simple tech stuff everybody should know, but they
don't, which irritates me more than it should. As the speaker says:

> For some reason, there's no standard syllabus, there's no basic course. They
> just sort of give you your computer and then kick you out of the nest. You're
> supposed to learn this stuff how? Just by osmosis. Nobody ever sits down and
> tells you, "This is how it works."

For the "TL;DR" people, the video is at the end of the post.

For the "I don't have time for the video" people, I wrote a list of the tips,
based on the transcript of the talk:

1. On the web, **use the** `space bar` **to scroll down**: it scrolls down one
   page and you don't waste time by rotating the mouse wheel or dragging two
   fingers on your touchpad. Shift+spacebar is the opposite: one page up. Works
   on every computer, every browser.
2. Use the `tab` key to move forward in form boxes, `shift+tab` to go
   backwards. When you **select the pop-up menu, just press the letter of what
   you want** to select. In the speaker's example, in a "choose your state" form
   "type the first letter of your state over and over and over. So if you want
   Connecticut, go `C`, `C`, `C`. If you want Texas, go `T`, `T`, and you jump
   right to that thing without even opening the pop-up menu." Works also if you
   open the pop-up menu.
3. To **increase the text size of a web page:** `control+plus` (`cmd+plus` on
   a Mac). Substitute the `plus` with `minus` for the opposite.
4. When typing on your phone, **don't bother to press** `dot`, `spacebar`
   and `shift`** to insert a capital letter. Just **press** `spacebar` **twice**
   and it's done.
5. "If you want **to redial** somebody that you've dialed before, all you have
   to do is **hit the call button**, and it puts the last phone number into the
   box for you,and at that point you can hit call again to actually dial it."
6. Voicemail (NOTE: this shortcuts may not be applied in every nation): The
   carrier's **instructions** on how to let a message **can be skipped** by
   pressing the following shortcuts for USA:
    1. Verizon: `*`
    2. AT&T, T-Mobile: `#`
    3. Sprint: `I`
7. **Use Google as**:
    1. calculator: type the math, e.g.: `7569/7` or even `plot sin(3x-2)`
    2. unit conversion: `5 € to $`, `1 km to mile`, `3 months in days`
    3. dictionary: type `define serendipity` and you will get the explanation
       what this strange word means
8. **To highlight a word, just double click it**, don't drag the mouse all over
   the whole word. To delete the highlighted text, just type over it, don't
   delete and then type.
9. Your camera takes too much time to take the picture? "Shutter lag is the
   time between your pressing the shutter button and the moment the camera
   actually snaps. [...] So that's because the camera needs time to calculate
   the focus and the exposure, but if you **pre-focus with a half-press**, leave
   your finger down, no shutter lag! You get it every time."
10. When giving a talk with **slides** on your computer (like PowerPoint,
    Keynote, LibreOffice, OpenOffice or a PDF file), hit the **letter** `B`
    to **Black out the screen** so the audience will pay attention to you and
    not to the presentation. `W` to un-blank it again.

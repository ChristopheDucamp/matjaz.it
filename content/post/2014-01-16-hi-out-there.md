Finally this blog started working. I registered this domain like 7000 years ago
and never used the web hosting, only the e-mail system provided with it. Quite
stupid, ha? But anyway, now it's time to start. I'll be writing in English
because I know many people who don't speak the same language, so let's be
universal. And who knows? Maybe something I'll type here will help somebody over
the internet ;)

See you soon with another post.

P.S.: the blog theme is going to change, but I'm still unsure on how exactly it
should look like...

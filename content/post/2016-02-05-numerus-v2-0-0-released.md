[Numerus](https://github.com/TheMatjaz/Numerus), my roman numerals library has been completely updated!



### Java Numerus becomes jNumerus



First of all, the Java library for roman numerals has been renamed from _Numerus_ to _[jNumerus](https://github.com/TheMatjaz/jNumerus)_ and it's development is discontinued. There are some potential improvements in some _feature/_ branches, but they will probably stay there.



### 





### Rewritten in C, more features and optimizations



On the other hand, theÂ project has been ported and **completely rewritten in C**. Some careful optimization has been done with many added features like support for numerals with values outside `[-3999, 3999]` and float values and numerals. For more info, check out the [changelog](https://github.com/TheMatjaz/Numerus/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). Also bugfixeeees!



### More documentation and clean code



[Doxygen generated documentation](http://thematjaz.github.io/Numerus/) of the code tries to help as much as possible any library user.



### Still available as a command line utility



The C version also support a command line interface (CLI) useful for on-the-fly conversions and pipelining, since every main argument is parsed as a command of the internal Numerus shell.

So, I had to add a new post category "Random happening" for this post, just because I couldn't find any matching one. Yes, it's true, that I don't have much written on here, but anyways...

A few days ago I was returning home late in the evening, the time was about 23:00. I was very tired, since I woke up at 6:00 and started working early. Driving on an empty road makes me sleepy so I decided to turn on the radio and listen to some music, just to stay awake. And what's on the radio during the night?

Of course a special music show, discovering underground music genres:"_And now we are going to listen to a very special band from some strange place and they are going to play their most famous drone song, listen up!_"

[Drone music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_music). Seriously? And this would somehow keep me awake? It was pretty much like this:



Now, I try to be very open minded about music, but I really don't understand this genre. It's more a sound compilation than a combination of notes, melodies, harmony and rhythm. Can somebody help me and explain why do you like it? :)

Oh, I almost forgot: the next day, same time, same sleepiness, new genre: congotronics. And my reactions was pretty much the same: this is not waking me up, radio!

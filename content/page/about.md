### Background


The idea of this blog started a long before I actually started to write something on it. It was under construction for something like 2-3 years (or even more, I can't remember). But now it's alive and kicking. Well, some things are still to be done or done better - just have some patience please.


### Who is writing the blog?


Our extremely trained public relations team. Nah, just kidding, it's just me, a normal person (I hope).

I'm a geek, an IT fanatic and have many things in my mind I'd like to say - so this blog could be the best way. Some may describe me as a loquacious stubborn workaholic that may bore you, some others as a person that likes to bring some happiness and help around. I don't know if those descriptions are accurate, what do you think?

Also [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheMatjaz) is a collection of some neuronal activity of mine, check it out!


### What do you write about?


I love technology, music, psychology, physics and other geeky stuff, so this will be more or less the arguments of this blog. I hope that what I write could help others in their lives, in their usage of technology and many other things. Some adventures, some particular events, general thoughts or other stuff may happen sometimes ;)


### Wait, why are you writing in english? It's not your mother-tongue...


Correct, it's actually the 4th language I've learned and since I'm not an expert please correct me, if you find some errors. I'd appreciate it, since I'm a grammar-nazi too ;) I've chosen english* because it's universal, since I know many people of different mother-tongues. Also by writing in english I can hope somebody else in the world will find what I write useful or at least fascinating.

## Who are you?

Our extremely trained public relations team. Nah, just kidding, it's just me, a
normal person (I hope).

My name is Matjaž Guštin. I'm a geek, an IT fanatic and have many things in my
mind I'd like to say - so this blog could be the best way. Some may describe me
as a loquacious stubborn workaholic that may bore you, some others as a person
that likes to bring some happiness and help around. I don't know if those
descriptions are accurate, what do you think?

Also [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheMatjaz) is a collection of some
neuronal activity of mine, check it out!


## What do you write about?

I love technology, psychology, physics and other geeky stuff but the arguments
of this blog will mainly be **security, privacy, software, databases, Unix &
other IT-stuff**. I hope that what I write could help others in their lives, in
their usage of technology and many other things.

## Wait, why are you writing in English? It's not your mother-tongue...

Correct, it's actually the 4th language I've learned and since I'm not an expert
please correct me, if you find some errors. I'd appreciate it, since I'm a
grammar-nazi as well. I've chosen English[*] because it's universal, since I
know many people of different mother-tongues. Also by writing in English I can
hope somebody else in the world will find what I write useful or at least
fascinating.

[*] some posts may be in other languages.

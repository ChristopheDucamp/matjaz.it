I like to program stuff, you can find all my code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/TheMatjaz).


## [Numerus](https://github.com/TheMatjaz/Numerus)

A comprehensive C library for conversion and manipulation of
**[roman numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals)**.

This library allows you to convert roman numerals to values and values to roman
numerals, adds some extensions to them to **support big and float values** that
other converters of the same kind usually don't, focuses on **optimization,
clean code and error handling**. Also offers a **Numerus shell** to convert
values on-the-fly or by pipelining (on Unix-like OS) without the need to include
the library in an existing project.


## [jNumerus](https://github.com/TheMatjaz/jNumerus)

The (not so complete but working) father of **Numerus written in Java**,
including objects to represent roman numerals and their values.


## [My dotfiles](https://github.com/TheMatjaz/dotfiles)

Yet another **dotfiles repository** but now with **one git-branch per OS** each
with its own installer and updater scripts. Dotfiles are configuration files on
Unix-like OS for user customization for text editors, shells, aliases and so on
saved in the home directory as `.filename`.


## [SQL Playcard](http://matjaz.it/french-playing-cards-for-poker-in-postgresql-mysql-and-sqlite/)

A simple SQL script to represent and store **standard french playing cards**
(those used in Poker) **for a few RDBMS**.
